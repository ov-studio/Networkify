**vNetworkify** is a open source lightweight yet safe, secure & reliable cross-platform (Client, Server) networking library that you can rely on without stressing about performances issues, since the library is developed with '**Performance-First**' in mind! vNetworkify provides built-in REST & Socket APIs out of the box that you may usually need for any simple to complex projects.

Tired of using bloatwares? unnecessary dependencies? redundant codes? reinventing wheels? additional/unoptimized modules? searching for single file library?; Don't worry we've got you covered! vNetworkify implements networking servers & exports them along w/ addon APIs; thus letting you utllize them w/o having to import `express`, `ws` or any addiitional libraries separately. Nevertheless you can import them from vNetworkify for any specific usecases.
